# DistSys2019Assignment1
Deliverables:
• Source code with readable, commented code (preferred in GitHub)
• Screenshots or 1 min video of your working implementation
• Report: 
1) A thorough final report about the project’s purpose and core functionality; 
2) your
system design using the 3 principles from the lectures (architecture, processes, communication),
3) problems encountered, and lessons learned. 
4) Instructions for installation and execution;
5) Answer the following questions with your implementation: i). What is the average time for
sending 50 messages between two nodes (random payload)? ii). Choose 3 different fixed
message sizes (payloads for min, average, max), what is the average time when sending 25 in
each case? iii). Choose a unique payload, e.g., average size, and then measure the inter arrival
rate between messages? iv). How reliable is your architecture? What kind of applications can
benefit from this architectural flavor? 


What we have done already:
1. Proven design for a 3 player Rock, paper and scissors game (John)
2. Implemented networked pipeline in python for 2 player Rock, paper and scissors game.(Suravi)

Following Tasks:
1. - Updating the game to handle timeout and 3 players(John)
   - Updating the server for 3 palyers

2. - Fixing current python impelmentation issues to finalize the game for 2 palyers(Suravi)
   - Updating the client for 3 palyers(Suravi)
   
3. - Writing the report: (Rola, John [Design section]).
